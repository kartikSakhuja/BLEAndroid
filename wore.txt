We need to build an app for iOS and Android. Would it be possible to write most of
the code once and have it run on both iOS and Android? If so, what would be your
approach?

Yes, it is possible to write most of the code once and run on both iOS and Android on any cross platform app development tecnology 
such as React-Native or Flutter (Using Dart as a programming language),
however there will be platform specific implications that wont be addressed if native code is not used. 
So, i would defintely prefer to use native app development than using cross platform but if have to use it, i would go for flutter.
